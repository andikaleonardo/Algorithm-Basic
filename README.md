## What are the features?
The Swift Summary Book takes advantage of the Playground platform and many of its powerful capabilities:
* The book is made of a single file that contains all chapters inside, which allows for easy access.
* Chapters use the Playground Markup Language, which brings rich documentation to the code examples.
* Every chapter has Page Linking, which allows to go back and forth from one chapter to the next, previous or another that was mentioned with in the chapter.
